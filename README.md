# mcp-agent-mslearnQ&A
This is to build an agent that connects to a cloud-hosted MCP server. The agent will use AI-powered search to help developers find accurate, real-time answers from Microsoft’s official documentation. 
It is useful for building assistants that support developers with up-to-date guidance on tools like Azure, .NET, and Microsoft 365. The agent will use the available MCP tools to query the documentation and return relevant results.
